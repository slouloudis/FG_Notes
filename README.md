# Fighting Game Notes
A website for recording fighting game notation - right now, only for Tekken 7

Teammembers: me!

Problem - there are no websites that allow players to record their own notes 
about matchups and characters. 

Libraries used - 
Greensock Animation Package. (cdn, with scroll plugin)


TODO -- Notes page:
1. text area: form 
2. Tag system tagify.
3. search system for tags. 



big issues - layout. I used 0.5 scale on layout. blah - fixedÂ¬
